### 🔷 Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium  

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.  

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3^x`.  

**Example:**  

Input: `n = 12`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: `12 = 3^1 + 3^2`  

Input: `n = 91`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: `91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4`  

Input: `n = 21`  
Output: `false`  

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= n <= 10^7`  

**Hints:**  
1. The maximum power of `3` needed in the solution is `3^16`.  
2. A number cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of `3` if its ternary representation contains a `2`.

### 🔷 Partition Array According to Given Pivot  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium  

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a `0`-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. Rearrange `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:  

1. Every element **less than** `pivot` appears **before** every element **greater than** `pivot`.  
2. Every element **equal to** `pivot` appears **in between** the elements less than and greater than `pivot`.  
3. The **relative order** of the elements less than `pivot` and the elements greater than `pivot` is **maintained**.  

More formally, consider every `pi`, `pj` where `pi` is the new position of the `i`-th element and `pj` is the new position of the `j`-th element. If `i < j` and both elements are smaller (or larger) than `pivot`, then `pi < pj`.  

Return `nums` after the rearrangement.  

**Example:**  

Input: `nums = [9,12,5,10,14,3,10]`, `pivot = 10`  
Output: `[9,5,3,10,10,12,14]`  
Explanation:  
- The elements `{9, 5, 3}` are **less than** `pivot` and appear on the **left**.  
- The elements `{12, 14}` are **greater than** `pivot` and appear on the **right**.  
- The relative ordering of `{9, 5, 3}` and `{12, 14}` is preserved.  

Input: `nums = [-3,4,3,2]`, `pivot = 2`  
Output: `[-3,2,4,3]`  
Explanation:  
- The element `-3` is **less than** `pivot` and appears on the **left**.  
- The elements `{4, 3}` are **greater than** `pivot` and appear on the **right**.  
- The relative ordering of `[-3]` and `[4, 3]` is maintained.  

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`  
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`  
- `pivot` is guaranteed to be an element of `nums`.  

**Hints:**  
1. Can you store the elements **smaller** than `pivot` and **greater** than `pivot` in separate lists while maintaining order?  
2. Once you have the separate lists, can you concatenate them to get the final result?

### 🔷 Closest Prime Numbers in Range  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium  

**Problem Statement:**  
Given two positive integers `left` and `right`, find two integers `num1` and `num2` such that:  

1. `left <= num1 < num2 <= right`
2. Both `num1` and `num2` are **prime numbers**.
3. `num2 - num1` is the **minimum** among all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.  

Return the array `ans = [num1, num2]`. If there are **multiple** pairs with the same minimum gap, return the one with the smallest `num1`. If no such pair exists, return `[-1, -1]`.  

**Example:**  

Input: `left = 10, right = 19`  
Output: `[11,13]`  
Explanation:  
The prime numbers between `10` and `19` are `[11, 13, 17, 19]`.  
The closest gap is `2`, which can be achieved by `[11,13]` or `[17,19]`.  
Since `11` is the smallest starting number, we return `[11,13]`.  

Input: `left = 4, right = 6`  
Output: `[-1,-1]`  
Explanation:  
Only one prime (`5`) exists in the range, so no valid pair can be formed.  

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= left <= right <= 10^6`  

**Hints:**  
1. Use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to efficiently find prime numbers.  
2. Iterate through the primes in the given range to find the closest pair.

### 🔷 Count Total Number of Colored Cells  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium  

**Problem Statement:**  
There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must perform the following routine for `n` minutes:  

1. At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.  
2. Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.  

Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes `1`, `2`, and `3`.
</br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dd7879a-ab01-4de8-be48-3cb8cb4d3310" alt="drawing" width="400" align='center'/></br>

**Example:**  

Input: `n = 1`   
Output: `1`   
Explanation: `After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.`  

Input: `n = 2`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: `After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5. `  
 

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`  

**Hints:**  
1. Observe the pattern of expansion in each step.  
2. Consider deriving a formula based on the number of cells added per minute.

### 🔶 Alternating Groups II  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium  

**Problem Statement:**  
There is a circle of **red** and **blue** tiles. You are given an array `colors` and an integer `k`. The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:  

- `colors[i] == 0` means that tile `i` is **red**.
- `colors[i] == 1` means that tile `i` is **blue**.  

An **alternating group** is a contiguous subarray of `k` tiles in the circle where the tiles alternate in color (each tile in the group except the first and last one must have a different color from its left and right tiles).

Return the number of alternating groups.  

**Note:**  
Since `colors` represents a **circle**, the first and last tiles are considered to be next to each other.  

**Example:**  

Input: `colors = [0,1,0,1,0], k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation:

### ✅ Count of Substrings Containing Every Vowel and K Consonants II  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a string `word` and a non-negative integer `k`.  
Return the total number of substrings of `word` that contain every vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') at least once and exactly `k` consonants.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** word = "aeioqq", k = 1  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** There is no substring with every vowel.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** word = "aeiou", k = 0  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** The only substring with every vowel and zero consonants is word[0..4], which is "aeiou".

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** word = "ieaouqqieaouqq", k = 1  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The substrings with every vowel and one consonant are:  
- word[0..5], which is "ieaouq".  
- word[6..11], which is "qieaou".  
- word[7..12], which is "ieaouq".  

**Constraints:**  
- 5 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5  
- word consists only of lowercase English letters.  
- 0 <= k <= word.length - 5.  

**Hints:**  
1. We can use sliding window and binary search.  
2. For each index `r`, find the maximum `l` such that both conditions are satisfied using binary search.
