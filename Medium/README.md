### ✅ Robot Bounded In Circle  
**Difficulty:** 🟠 Medium  

**Problem Statement:**  
On an infinite plane, a robot starts at `(0,0)` facing north. It can receive three instructions:  
- `"G"`: Move forward 1 unit.  
- `"L"`: Turn 90° left (anti-clockwise).  
- `"R"`: Turn 90° right (clockwise).  

The robot executes the given instructions repeatedly. Return `true` if the robot remains within a circle, otherwise return `false`.  

**Example:**  

**Input:** `instructions = "GGLLGG"`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** The robot returns to `(0,0)` after one cycle.  

**Input:** `instructions = "GG"`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** The robot moves straight indefinitely.  

**Input:** `instructions = "GL"`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** The robot follows a cycle and returns to `(0,0)`.  

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`  
- `instructions[i]` is `"G"`, `"L"`, or `"R"`.  

**Hints:**  
1. Track the final position and direction after one execution of instructions.  
2. The robot is bounded if it changes direction or returns to `(0,0)`.
